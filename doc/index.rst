   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Celer
======

This is a library to run the Constraint Elimination for the Lasso with Extrapolated Residuals (Celer) algorithm [1].
This algorithm uses an extrapolated dual point which enables a tight control of optimality and quick feature identification.

Installation
------------
First clone the repository available at https://github.com/mathurinm/celer::

    $ git clone https://github.com/mathurinm/celer.git
    $ cd celer/


We recommend to use the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_,
and create a conda environment with::

    $ conda env create --file environment.yml

Then, you can compile the Cython code and install the package with::

    $ source activate celer-env
    $ pip install --no-deps -e .

To check if everything worked fine, you can do::

    $ source activate celer-env
    $ python -c 'import celer'

and it should not give any error message.

From a Python shell you can just do::

    >>> import celer

If you don't want to use Anaconda, the list of packages you need to install is in the `environment.yml` file.
